# rshift
An R library for paleoecology and regime shift analysis.  
These functions assume your data is in tidy format.

# Current features
rshift mainly focuses around Rodionov (2004)'s STARS algorithm. A detailed explanation of the algorithm, and how to use it for regime shift analysis in R, is [available here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rshift/vignettes/STARSmanual.pdf), or in R itself with the command `vignette("STARSmanual")` 

For further documentation and help with rshift, either run `help(packages = "rshift")`, or view the documentation [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rshift).
